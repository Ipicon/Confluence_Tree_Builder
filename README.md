# Confluence Tree Builder

## The script takes a tree of folders and publishes to the desired confluence host

***
***Tested on Confluence server and Data Center 7.12***
***

### First Run:

- Run ` pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
- ***DEPRECATED*** Run with `--init-db` to get all the live pages on the confluence server and handle pages with the
  same name
- No need for anything else ðŸ˜Š, once the script sees a page which already exists - it automatically retries with a
  higher occurrences index

### Arguments:

- `-h ` or `--help` to get help
- `--use-link` to post attachments as hyperlinks
